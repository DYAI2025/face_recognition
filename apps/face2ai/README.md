# Face2AI

Face2AI is the local product layer built on top of the repository's existing `face_recognition` engine.

## Product flow

`UNKNOWN -> explicit LEARN -> leave frame -> return -> KNOWN -> greeting`

The application is intentionally local-first. Camera frames are processed in memory and are not intentionally persisted. Stored identity records contain display names and face encodings only.

## Architecture

- browser: camera preview, overlays, enrollment with explicit consent, identity management, event stream and spoken greeting; restrained ReactBits-inspired effects implemented as dependency-free CSS/ES modules (see `docs/UI_DIRECTION.md`);
- API: FastAPI on localhost;
- recognition: adapter over the repository's existing `face_recognition` package;
- expression (opt-in, ADR-003): a second port `ExpressionEngine` beside recognition — MediaPipe Face Landmarker + EmotiEffLib, local, CPU; attaches a hedged per-face hint (`faces[].expression`), a hysteresis `Presence.mood` and (Stage 2, ADR-004) live `Presence.valence/arousal`, facial actions (SSE `action`) and a bounded in-memory affect timeline; never part of matching, enrollment or greeting — see [Expression hints](#expression-hints-opt-in);
- storage: atomic local JSON file;
- presence + events: `GET /api/presence`, `GET /api/events` (SSE: `hello`, `presence`, `mood`, `action`, `timeline_cleared`, `store`, `heartbeat`), `POST /api/presence/reset` — the contract for agents / Party Mirror; no biometrics on the wire;
  - `presence` — stable presence changed (`from_state` → `to_state`, names, face count); a transition starts a fresh, mood-less presence and carries no mood fields;
  - `mood` — mood hint began/changed/ended (`from_mood` → `to_mood`, rounded valence/arousal); a `mood` with `to_mood: null` always follows the presence event that ended it (person left, presence expired or was reset), and is also published when expressions are switched off (`POST /api/expression {"enabled": false}`) while a mood is set; semantics in [Expression hints](#expression-hints-opt-in);
  - `action` — a completed facial action (`action` ∈ smile/frown/brow_raise/brow_furrow/eye_squint/eyes_wide/nose_wrinkle/lip_press, `onset_at`/`apex_at`/`offset_at`, `peak`, `duration_ms`, `frames`, names) — expression *dynamics* at frame-rate resolution (~0.6 s from the browser loop), never micro-expressions; a hint, never a fact, and consumers must not react to it with behaviour; an action whose offset is never seen (person left, reset, toggle off) produces no event;
- no LLM, cloud service, database, or security authorization in the recognition app itself. The optional voice agent (`apps/face2ai-agent/`, ADR-002) is a separate process that consumes the events.

Architecture decisions: `docs/architecture/ADR-001-local-modular-monolith.md` (local modular monolith), `ADR-002-voice-agent.md` (event-consuming voice agent), `ADR-003-expression-engine.md` (opt-in local expression hints), `ADR-004-expression-dynamics.md` (facial actions, live affect, in-memory timelines).

## Development

Target recognition runtime: Python 3.11 on macOS. On 2026-08-17 the recognition extra also built and ran on macOS/arm64 with Python 3.12 (dlib 20.0.1) via `uv sync --extra recognition`.

From the repository root:

```bash
uv sync --project apps/face2ai --group dev --extra recognition
uv run --project apps/face2ai face2ai
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

`uv.lock` is committed and is the only exact pin of the native stack: it resolves `dlib` to **20.0.1**
with a sha256, while the fork's `setup.py` asks only for `dlib>=19.7`. Reproduce the environment with
`uv sync --project apps/face2ai --frozen --group dev --extra recognition`; `--frozen` fails instead of
silently re-resolving. (This reverses an earlier decision that the lock is never committed — see
`docs/architecture/ADR-005-macos-launcher.md`.)

The `face_recognition` dependency is resolved from the repository root through `tool.uv.sources`. The temporary `setuptools<82` compatibility pin exists because the current model package still relies on `pkg_resources`; it is explicit S0 compatibility debt, not a permanent design choice.

## Configuration

Every setting is an environment variable read once by `Settings.from_env()` (`src/face2ai_app/config.py`).
There is no config file. This table is the **whole** surface — 19 variables, checked against the source
with `grep -o 'FACE2AI_[A-Z_]*' apps/face2ai/src/face2ai_app/config.py | sort -u | wc -l` (19). A value that
does not parse as the stated type raises at startup, so a typo fails visibly instead of silently falling
back to the default.

| Variable | Default | Range | Enforced? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FACE2AI_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | any bind address. Loopback is deliberate: the app has no authentication and must not be reachable from the network | n/a |
| `FACE2AI_PORT` | `8765` | `1..65535` | yes |
| `FACE2AI_DATA_DIR` | `~/.face2ai` | a directory; `~` is expanded. Holds `identities.json`, and `face2ai.log`/`face2ai.pid` when started through `scripts/face2ai-service.sh` | n/a |
| `FACE2AI_MATCH_TOLERANCE` | `0.6` | `0 < t <= 2` — Euclidean distance between face encodings; larger is more permissive. Never shown as a confidence percentage | yes |
| `FACE2AI_MAX_FRAME_BYTES` | `5242880` (5 MiB) | `>= 1` — request-body limit for `POST /api/recognize` and `/api/enroll` | yes |
| `FACE2AI_MAX_FRAME_PIXELS` | `4000000` (4 MP) | `>= 1` — decoded-pixel budget per frame, checked against the image header *before* decoding (a small file can declare an enormous image). Over the budget is `InvalidFrame` → HTTP 422 | yes |
| `FACE2AI_GREETING_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `15` | `>= 0` — reported by `/api/status`; the browser enforces it | yes |
| `FACE2AI_PRESENCE_STABLE_TICKS` | `2` | `>= 1` — frames a presence must hold before it is published | yes |
| `FACE2AI_PRESENCE_STALE_SECONDS` | `5` | `> 0` — a presence older than this expires to `NO_SIGNAL` | yes |
| `FACE2AI_EVENTS_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` | `15` | `> 0` — SSE `heartbeat` interval | yes |
| `FACE2AI_EVENTS_BUFFER_SIZE` | `200` | `>= 1` — replay buffer for `Last-Event-ID` | yes |
| `FACE2AI_EXPRESSION_ENABLED` | `false` | `1/true/yes/on` or `0/false/no/off`, case-insensitive; empty means default, anything else raises. Pre-enables only an *available* engine | yes |
| `FACE2AI_EXPRESSION_MODELS_DIR` | `$FACE2AI_DATA_DIR/models` (`~/.face2ai/models`) | a directory; `~` is expanded. `face_landmarker.task` is expected here | n/a |
| `FACE2AI_MOOD_STABLE_TICKS` | `3` | `>= 1` — consecutive frames a mood candidate must lead before it commits | yes |
| `FACE2AI_MOOD_MIN_SCORE` | `0.5` | `0 < s <= 1` — EMA score a mood needs at commit | yes |
| `FACE2AI_ACTION_ON_THRESHOLD` | `0.35` | `off < on <= 1` — blendshape group mean that starts a facial action | yes |
| `FACE2AI_ACTION_OFF_THRESHOLD` | `0.2` | `0 < off < on` — and ends it (hysteresis) | yes |
| `FACE2AI_ACTION_MIN_FRAMES` | `2` | `>= 1` — frames an action must persist before it is reported | yes |
| `FACE2AI_TIMELINE_SECONDS` | `600` | `>= 10` — in-memory affect history window (never persisted) | yes |

**Every range in this table is enforced, and two tests keep it that way.** Until Task 3 of
`docs/plans/2026-08-19-boundary-contracts.md` landed, four knobs were documentation only:
`Settings(port=70000)`, `match_tolerance=-1`, `max_frame_bytes=0` and `greeting_cooldown_seconds=-5`
were all accepted (measured at `3857adc`: 15 numeric fields, 11 range-checked in
`Settings.__post_init__`, 4 not — they had been added one commit at a time, each validating only its
own knobs). The owners that stop the next occurrence live in `tests/test_config.py`:

- `test_every_numeric_setting_is_validated` — every `int`/`float` field of `Settings` must be
  mentioned in `__post_init__`. Adding a numeric knob without a bound fails this test by name.
- `test_every_setting_is_documented` — every `FACE2AI_*` literal in `config.py` must appear in this
  table. Adding a knob without a row fails it. (Nine of the earlier eighteen were undocumented, and
  `FACE2AI_HOST`, `FACE2AI_PORT` and `FACE2AI_MATCH_TOLERANCE` were described only in a wrapper
  directory outside every repository.)

Neither test checks that a bound is the *right* one — that is what the per-knob cases next to them
are for. They check that a bound and a row exist at all, which is the failure mode this repository
actually had.

Read only by `scripts/face2ai-service.sh`, never by the application: `FACE2AI_START_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
(default `60`, how long `start` waits for `/healthz`) and `FACE2AI_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `10`, how
long `stop` waits after SIGTERM before SIGKILL).

## Running it as a background service

`scripts/face2ai-service.sh {start|stop|status}` owns the process from outside Python and is the unit the
macOS launcher (`docs/architecture/ADR-005-macos-launcher.md`) is a thin shell over:

```bash
apps/face2ai/scripts/face2ai-service.sh start    # refuses to start a second one; waits for /healthz
apps/face2ai/scripts/face2ai-service.sh status   # /healthz JSON on stdout, non-zero exit when down
apps/face2ai/scripts/face2ai-service.sh stop     # SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after FACE2AI_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
```

Log `~/.face2ai/face2ai.log` (appended, with a banner per start), pid `~/.face2ai/face2ai.pid`, both under
`$FACE2AI_DATA_DIR`. `start` is atomic — on timeout it prints the log tail, stops what it started and exits
non-zero. `stop` is idempotent and **never kills a process it did not start**: if `/healthz` answers while the
pid file records nothing alive, it refuses and exits non-zero, because that port may be held by a backend, a
voice agent and an SSH tunnel this script knows nothing about. The SIGKILL escalation is not optional today:
with one SSE subscriber attached the current process ignores SIGTERM (see §3 of the boundary-contracts plan).

## Expression hints (opt-in)

The expression engine (Stage 1: ADR-003, Stage 2: ADR-004) reads facial expression **locally** and only when asked. Face2AI itself persists nothing about expression — Stage 2's affect history lives in bounded in-memory ring buffers, is cleared by `POST /api/presence/reset` and is gone on restart (the Hermes plugin mirrors the *current* presence snapshot — state, name, coarse mood/valence/arousal — plus its own bounded mood/action list into its plugin state file for the dashboard process: overwritten, no long-term storage). Nothing leaves the machine, and none of it gates recognition, enrollment or the greeting. It is a hint about how a face *appears* to a model — the UI says "looks happy", "brief smile (0.9 s)", the German consumers say "wirkt fröhlich", "kurzes Lächeln (0.9 s)" — never a fact, never a lie detector. **"Micro-expressions" in the strict (involuntary, < 500 ms) sense are out of scope**: the loop runs at ~1.7 fps, so timing resolves to about 0.6 s. Stage 1 delivers expression + intensity + head pose per frame plus a hysteresis mood; Stage 2 adds expression *dynamics* (onset/apex/offset, peak, duration), live valence/arousal on the presence and a short affect timeline.

Install and fetch both model assets (≈ 0.75 GB installed — mediapipe pulls jax/jaxlib, opencv, matplotlib). The fetch script downloads BOTH files up front — the MediaPipe landmarker and EmotiEffLib's ONNX model into the exact cache path emotiefflib expects — so startup never touches the network; if either file is missing the engine reports `expression_available:false` with the path and this script in the reason instead of downloading anything:

```bash
uv sync --project apps/face2ai --group dev --extra recognition --extra expression
bash apps/face2ai/scripts/fetch-expression-models.sh      # face_landmarker.task (3.7 MB) → $FACE2AI_EXPRESSION_MODELS_DIR
                                                          # enet_b0_8_va_mtl.onnx (16 MB)  → ~/.emotiefflib/
```

`mediapipe` is pinned to 0.10.21 (1.0.1 aborts on macOS in `DrishtiMetalHelper`; the adapter uses the CPU delegate) and declares `numpy<2`, so `pyproject.toml` overrides numpy to 2.3.5 — verified working on the M1. Without the extra everything degrades cleanly: `expression_available:false` with a reason, toggle disabled, `faces[].expression` null, no `mood` events.

Environment: `FACE2AI_EXPRESSION_ENABLED`, `FACE2AI_EXPRESSION_MODELS_DIR`, `FACE2AI_MOOD_STABLE_TICKS`, `FACE2AI_MOOD_MIN_SCORE` and, for the Stage 2 dynamics (ADR-004), `FACE2AI_ACTION_ON_THRESHOLD`, `FACE2AI_ACTION_OFF_THRESHOLD`, `FACE2AI_ACTION_MIN_FRAMES`, `FACE2AI_TIMELINE_SECONDS`. Defaults and ranges live in one place: [Configuration](#configuration).

API surface:

- `POST /api/expression` with `{"enabled": true|false}` — per-session runtime toggle, off by default; 409 when enabling while the engine is unavailable, disabling is always accepted (200); switching off ends the current mood immediately (a `mood` event with `to_mood: null`). Response `{"enabled", "available"}`.
- `GET /api/status` — `expression_available`, `expression_reason`, `expression_enabled`.
- `POST /api/recognize` — while enabled each `faces[]` observation carries `expression`: `{dominant, scores{Anger,Contempt,Disgust,Fear,Happiness,Neutral,Sadness,Surprise}, valence, arousal, blendshapes{name: 0..1, only ≥ 0.2}, yaw, pitch, roll}` — or `null` when the engine could not read that face. No landmarks, crops or pixels are ever on the wire.
- `GET /api/presence` / SSE `hello`, `heartbeat` — `Presence.mood` (the hysteresis label, null until committed) and `valence`, `arousal` — since Stage 2 the *live* smoothed values (EMA over the readable frames, rounded to 3), present as soon as one frame was readable, null while nothing is; the `mood` event keeps the values frozen at commit.
- `GET /api/expression/timeline?seconds=600` — the bounded in-memory affect history `{seconds, samples[{at, identity_id, display_name, mood, valence, arousal}], moods[MoodTransition], actions[ActionEvent]}` of the last `seconds` (10..3600, default 600 = `FACE2AI_TIMELINE_SECONDS`), oldest first. Add `identity_id=<id>` to narrow it to one known person; omit it for everyone (an empty value is treated as omitted, not as "nobody"). Never persisted: cleared by `POST /api/presence/reset` and by a restart.
- SSE `mood` — emitted once per stable mood change (server-side `MoodTracker`: EMA over the scores, alpha 0.5; a label commits when the candidate has led for `FACE2AI_MOOD_STABLE_TICKS` consecutive frames and its EMA is ≥ `FACE2AI_MOOD_MIN_SCORE` at that tick; valence/arousal are frozen at commit). The mood follows the stable presence: a presence change, `stable_ticks` frames without a readable expression (several faces, no face, expression off), presence expiry/reset or the toggle-off end it with `to_mood: null`. The browser's "Mood" and "Expression" event-stream entries come from this stream (`static/js/events.js`, an `EventSource` on `/api/events?role=browser`) — the server is the single source of truth and the Stage 1 client-side debounce is gone; the tile's valence sparkline is the one local view (this page's own last ~120 readings).
- SSE `action` — one completed facial action per event (`ActionTracker`, ADR-004): a group of blendshapes starts an action at `FACE2AI_ACTION_ON_THRESHOLD` (0.35), keeps it while it stays at or above `FACE2AI_ACTION_OFF_THRESHOLD` (0.2) and completes it on the first frame below, but only after `FACE2AI_ACTION_MIN_FRAMES` (2) frames. Speech articulators (`jawOpen`, `mouthFunnel`, `mouthPucker`, `mouthClose`) and blinks are deliberately not action groups. An action whose offset is never seen produces no event, and nothing may react to one with behaviour.
- SSE `timeline_cleared` — `{at}` and nothing else, published by `POST /api/presence/reset` when the clear actually dropped something. Consumers that mirror the `mood`/`action` stream (Hermes plugin, panes) forget with it; a `presence` transition to `NO_SIGNAL` is *not* that signal, because an ordinary presence expiry publishes one too and keeps the history. Consumers that keep no history (the voice agent) ignore it.
- The browser's own log discipline (`static/js/app.js`, hints stay hints): a replayed entry — `EventSource` resumes with `Last-Event-ID` and the server replays up to 200 buffered events — is dropped instead of being stamped with the current time (`isFreshEntry`, 10 s), and the same action label is displayed at most every 5 s (`allowActionEntry`) so a talking face cannot flush the 8-slot stream. Neither re-derives anything: the server stays the source of truth.

Measured on the M1 (2026-08-18, one face): adapter alone (full-frame decode + landmarker + EmotiEffLib, `examples/obama.jpg`, 910×1137) `analyze` ~146 ms cold / ~77 ms warm on the first measurement, ~84 / ~27 ms on a later warm run; live `POST /api/recognize` round trip via curl (dlib HOG + expression) `examples/obama-480p.jpg` (853×480) ~130 ms → ~150 ms with expression, `examples/obama.jpg` ~300 ms → ~330–380 ms — expression adds ~30–50 ms per frame, inside the browser's 450 ms loop.

Shell and `/assets/*` are served with `Cache-Control: no-cache` (ETag revalidation) since 2026-08-18 — a redeploy must never pair a fresh `app.js` with a heuristically cached `model.js` (this broke the shell once during verification).

Legal note, honesty section, dependency facts and review triggers: `docs/architecture/ADR-003-expression-engine.md` (Stage 1) and `docs/architecture/ADR-004-expression-dynamics.md` (Stage 2: why "micro-expressions" are out of scope, why speech articulators are not actions, what the shared `UNKNOWN:` key means for a timeline). Manual gates: `docs/boilerplate/VALIDATION.md`.

## Verification

```bash
PYTHONPATH=apps/face2ai/src pytest apps/face2ai/tests
python -m compileall -q apps/face2ai/src
for file in apps/face2ai/src/face2ai_app/static/js/*.js; do node --check "$file"; done
node --test 'apps/face2ai/tests/js/**/*.test.mjs'
```

Real recognition is not proven by unit tests. Before calling the product flow runtime-verified, run the target-Mac camera smoke described in `docs/boilerplate/VALIDATION.md`.
