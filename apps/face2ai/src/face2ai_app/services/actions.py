"""Facial action dynamics from blendshape intensities: onset -> apex -> offset per action group.

Pure and per-presence like ``MoodTracker``. Each action is the mean of a small blendshape group;
a hysteresis state machine (``on_threshold`` to start, ``off_threshold`` to end) turns the per-frame
series into one ``ActionEvent`` per completed action. Timing is quantized to the frame rate — at the
browser's loop (~1.7 fps) that is ~0.6 s, so these are expression *dynamics*, not micro-expressions;
the event says how long and how strong, never why. Speech articulators (jawOpen, mouthFunnel,
mouthPucker, mouthClose) and blinks are deliberately not action groups.

    """Hysteresis state machine per action group over ``Expression.blendshapes``.

    Per frame every group's intensity (``action_intensity``) is compared against two thresholds: an
    inactive action starts when it reaches ``on_threshold``; an active one keeps going (frames counted,
    peak/apex updated) while it stays at or above ``off_threshold`` and completes on the first frame
    below it. Completion yields an ``ActionEvent`` (onset/apex/offset timestamps, peak, duration,
    frames) — but only if the action lasted at least ``min_frames`` frames; shorter spikes are
    swallowed as noise. Several actions can be active at once (smile + eye squint).

    Like ``MoodTracker`` the tracker follows the presence it decorates: a change of ``presence_key``
    (state or identity changed) drops whatever was active *without* an event — the offset is unknown
    and is never guessed. An unreadable frame (``expression is None``) drops active actions the same
    way. Timestamps are those of the observed frames, so onset/offset resolution equals the frame
    interval (~0.6 s from the browser loop); ``duration_ms`` is offset - onset and therefore a
    lower bound of the true duration by up to one frame on either side.
