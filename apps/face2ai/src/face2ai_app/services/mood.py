class MoodTracker:
    """Turns per-frame expression scores into a stable mood with hysteresis.

    Per frame the emotion ``scores`` are smoothed with an EMA (``alpha``; labels missing from a
    frame count as 0.0; ``expression.dominant`` is ignored — the EMA over scores decides). The
    argmax of the EMA is the *candidate*; it becomes the mood once it has been the candidate for
    ``stable_ticks`` consecutive frames and its EMA is at least ``min_score``. Only a candidate
    that differs from the current mood produces a transition, so a committed mood survives brief
    flicker until another label wins the same race.

    The tracker follows the presence it decorates: a change of ``presence_key`` (state or
    identity changed) resets the smoothing immediately and ends the current mood; ``stable_ticks``
    consecutive frames without an expression end it as well. Either produces one
    ``mood -> None`` transition, and only if a mood was set. Frames without an expression (``None``
    or empty ``scores``) never touch the EMA or the streak; they only count towards that reset.

    Valence/arousal are smoothed alongside but *frozen at commit time*: ``current()`` and the
    transition carry the values as of the moment the mood was committed, not the live EMA. This
    is deliberate — it keeps the wire quiet (one change per mood, not per frame); Stage 2 may add
    live affect as its own signal.
