    """Bounded in-memory affect timeline: live valence/arousal samples, mood changes, facial actions.

    Three ring buffers (``collections.deque(maxlen=…)``) hold the last ``max_samples`` ``AffectSample``s,
    the last ``max_moods`` ``MoodTransition``s and the last ``max_actions`` ``ActionEvent``s. Samples are
    additionally bounded by age: ``record_sample()`` drops leading samples older than ``max_seconds``
    relative to the newest sample, so the buffer never holds more than one window even at a slow
    frame rate. ``snapshot()`` answers ``GET /api/expression/timeline`` with everything inside
    ``[now - seconds, now]`` (inclusive on both ends), optionally narrowed to one identity.

    This history lives **in memory only**: nothing is ever persisted, and it is cleared on
    ``POST /api/presence/reset`` and on restart (``clear()``). It stores what the wire already
    carries — timestamps, labels, names, rounded scalars — never frames, landmarks or per-frame
    scores. Like everything expression-related it is a hint, never a fact, and gates nothing.
